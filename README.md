# Kubeflow Pipeline meets uv

There is a more exhaustive explanation in [this blog post](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/posts/kubeflow-uv.html)

Here's code that implements a custom kubeflow pipeline components with dynamic dependency resolution
Typically, when defining a Kubeflow Pipeline component, you explicitly list the Python packages to install using the packages_to_install argument in `kfp.dsl.component` or by baking them into a custom Docker image
This repository showcases a custom approach to defining Kubeflow Pipeline components that automatically resolve their Python package dependencies based on a `pyproject.toml` file.
This simplifies component development and management by centralizing dependency declarations.


## Usage

Make sure you have `uv` installed and available in your system.

The `pipeline.py` script is the main entry point for running the data processing pipeline.
To run the pipeline, navigate to the project's root directory and run `pipeline.py`.

Using `uv`:
```bash
uv run pipeline.py
```

Activating virtual environment manually:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python pipeline.py
```
